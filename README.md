# Graph-to-Graph Transformer
Pytorch implementation of ["Graph-to-Graph Transformer for Transition-based Dependency Parsing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03561)

## Sentence Transformer

To reproduce results of SentTr and SentTr+G2GTr model, you can find all required materials in `senttr` directory.

## State Transformer

To reproduce results of all variations of StateTr model, you can find all required materials in `statetr` directory.

## General Graph-to-Graph Transformer

To use our Graph-to-Graph Transformer for other NLP tasks, plese refere to [this repository](https://github.com/idiap/g2g-transformer).
